# Internship Task-2: Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning classification model to predict Titanic passenger survival using the Titanic dataset.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and encoding
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

## Files
- `titanic_task2.ipynb` â€” Jupyter notebook with code and output
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python dependencies

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook titanic_task2.ipynb
```

## Model Performance
Achieved accuracy: ~0.78 on test data
